# DevOps-Learning-Networking

This repository shows my learning journey through Networking. This covers topics ranging from basic to advanced levels of Networking for DevOps.  

# What I learnt...

1. **OSI Model** – The 7 layers that standardize how devices communicate.
2. **TCP/IP Model** – A practical 4-layer model the internet actually runs on.
3. **Ports & Protocols** – The doors (ports) and languages (protocols) of networking.
4. **DNS (Domain Name System)** – The phonebook of the internet.
5. **Routing** – How data finds the best path across networks.
6. **Subnetting & CIDR** – Breaking networks into manageable chunks.
7. **NAT (Network Address Translation)** – How private IPs talk to the internet.

The OSI Model: 7 Layers That Power the Internet

Ever wondered how your app talks to a server across the world? Or why you don’t need to worry about whether your laptop is on Wi-Fi or Ethernet?

That’s thanks to the 𝐎𝐒𝐈 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 - 7 logical layers that keep the network tidy and manageable.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝟕 𝐎𝐒𝐈 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫𝐬 (𝐓𝐨𝐩 ↓ 𝐁𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐦)

7️⃣ 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 
Where users interact. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP empower web browsing, file transfers and email. 

6️⃣ 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 
Prepares data. Handles encryption (SSL/TLS), formatting and translating between formats. 

5️⃣ 𝐒𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 
Manages conversations. Sets up, maintains and closes sessions like keeping a video call alive or logging in/out. 

4️⃣ 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 
Reliable delivery. Uses 𝐓𝐂𝐏 for order and error-checked transfers, or 𝐔𝐃𝐏 when speed matters more. 

3️⃣ 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 
Routes data between networks. Uses IP addresses, routers and ICMP to move packets across networks. 

2️⃣ 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤 
Local node delivery. Uses MAC addresses and switches to frame and deliver data on the same network. 

1️⃣ 𝐏𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 
The actual wires, fibre and air. Transmits raw bits using electrical, light, or radio signals.
